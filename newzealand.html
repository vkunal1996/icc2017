                      The New Zealand cricket team, nicknamed the Black Caps, are the national cricket team representing New Zealand. They played their first Test in 1930 against England in Christchurch, New Zealand, becoming the fifth country to play Test cricket. From 1930 New Zealand had to wait until 1956, more than 26 years, for its first test victory, against the West Indies at Eden Park in Auckland.[8] They played their first ODI in the 1972â€“73 season against Pakistan in Christchurch.
